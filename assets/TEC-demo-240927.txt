Transit EMV Checker demo video 27/09/2024
=========================================

The MP4 video in this directory was created using the development version of the TEC Android app
on this date.

The steps in the demo are as follows:

1) The app is started from the Android home screen

2) The app displays the short disclaimer discouraging users from tapping live EMV cards too often.
This disclaimer is displayed every time the app is started.

3) The user clicks 'I UNDERSTAND AND AGREE'.

4) The app displays its home screen.

5) Normally the next step would be to click "START EMV MEDIA DETECTION" and present a card, but
in this demo, before doing this the user clicks the 'info' icon to go to the 'About' tab which
displays HTML text about the app, including a longer disclaimer about PCI and tapping live cards.
The video shows scrolling through this text, but the files about.pdf and long_disclaimer.pdf
are shared on the same Google Drive folder as the video and this file to make it easier to read
them.

6) The user returns to the home tab, clicks "START EMV MEDIA DETECTION" and presents a card
to the device.

7) When the card is detected messages appear in the home window, followed by a recommendation
to navigate to the 'Transit Capabilities' tab for analysis of issues likely to affect use of the
card in a transit setting.  The icon for this tab shows a pair of transit vehicles.

8) The user navigates to the tab and sees a short analysis of the card.

9) The user navigates to the 'EMV Details' tab and sees a short report containing the masked PAN,
PSN (if returned by the card) and expiry date.  This tab also contains a button which allows a
more detailed diagnostic report to be saved.

10) The user clicks on the button to save the diagnostic report in XML format, and the device
saves it in its externally accessible 'Downloads' directory.  The file saved in this demo has been
copied from the device over USB and is also in the Google Drive folder.
