<h3>Transit EMV Checker</h3>
<h4>Version %VERSION%</h4>
<p>Copyright Tim Littlefair 2024-<p>

<p>
    This application is intended to enable customer service and technical employees working
    in the mass transit/public transport industry to determine whether a contactless EMV card
    (or mobile wallet or wearable) is likely to be accepted at transport network validators.
</p>

<p>
    Transport network validators are not able to accept all cards which can be accepted
    at retail payment terminals as validators are generally not able to connect to the
    issuing bank's system as it would slow the flow of passengers down.  Cards can only
    be accepted if they implement security features which enable the transport validator
    to confirm that the account details on the card are genuine and the card is not a forgery
    or a clone of another physical card.
