This application is intended to enable customer service and technical employees working
in the mass transit/public transport industry to advise customers whose contactless EMV
cards are not accepted at transport validators.
<br/>
This application provides no features useful to a criminal intending to 'skim' a customer's
cEMV card in order to trigger an illicit payment.
<br/>
There is no legal impediment the developers are aware of to using this application on live cards,
but potential users should be aware of the following concerns:
<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
If a transport authority, operator or agent is accepting cEMV payments, it will be
bound by the regulations issued by the Payment Cards Industry Security Standards Council.
Organizations in this category should consult their internal specialists to determine
whether they are permitted to use this application.  Whether they are permitted may
depend on whether the PCI-DSS approval covering their system comes under PCI-DSS v4.0 or
PCI-DSS v3.2.1 (the earlier specification contains much stricter language in relation to
applications processing live PANs).
    </li>
    <li>
All cEMV cards contain counters of numbers of taps processed on the card, and the banks
issuing these cards will receive the current counter as part of transaction information
for every payment on the card.  Banks can and do check the sequence of counter values
received and may regard gaps in the sequence as evidence of risk of fraudulent use of
the card and apply an action like blocking the card which could be inconvenient to the
cardholder.  Tapping a card once on this application will result in a gap of one in the
transaction counter sequence at the bank, which is very unlikely to trigger action.
<em>It is strongly recommended that no card should be tapped on this application more
than once or at the most twice on any given day</em>.
    </li>
</ul>
